# Senior Level Developer Task - Note-Taking Application

## Objective:

Develop a sophisticated note-taking application that includes features like user authentication, note tagging, and filtering.

## Technical Requirements:

### Frontend:

- Use React to build an interactive and responsive user interface.
- Implement features for tagging notes and filtering based on tags or content.

### Backend:

- Create a RESTful API that supports advanced queries for filtering notes and managing note tags.
- Implement performance optimizations such as efficient querying and caching.

### Database:

- Store notes in a Postgres database.
- Enhance the database schema to support complex functionalities like tagging and advanced filtering.

### Additional Features:

- Implement detailed user activity logging and consider advanced security features such as OAuth.

## Deliverables:

- Source code with fully implemented advanced features.
- A detailed README file that includes detailed app setup, architectural decisions and feature documentation.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality: Implementation of all advanced features with high reliability.
- Code Quality: Advanced coding techniques and efficient, maintainable code.
- User Experience: The application should be highly usable and professional.

## Notes:

- Use vite for the frontend tooling and Express for the backend.
- Usage of FE design systems like Material-UI or Ant Design is encouraged.
- Consider the security implications of user authentication and data access.
- Use of ORM libraries is welcomed to facilitate database management and improve data handling.
- Innovations and improvements to the project are highly encouraged. Please document any such contributions in your README.
